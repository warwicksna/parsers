This is parser which currenly reads in a file of the form:

0	0
0	1
2	3
...

where this is two numbers on a line separated by a tab character.

It currently outputs in the form:

[0,0,[[1,1]]]
[2,0,[[3,1]]]

which says that vertex 0 has value 0 and an edge to vertex 1 with weight 1, and vertex 2 has value 0 and an edge to vertex 3 of value 1.

TODO
* Still outputs a lot of unneeded data, such as weight of edge, for some algorithms
* Prints to stdout
* Input file is hardcoded
* Output file should be user defined
